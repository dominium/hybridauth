User profile
============

After authentication, HybridAuth provide the connected user profile's in a rich, simple and **standardized structure**
across all the social APIs.

Also, keep in mind that not all social APIs will provide all the user data to third-party.

The `Hybridauth\User\Profile` object will be populated with as much information about the user as HybridAuth was able
to pull from the given API or authentication provider.

**Sample :**

```php
// Instantiate Github Adapter
$github = new Hybridauth\Provider\GitHub($config);

// Authenticate with the user
$github->authenticate();

// Retrieve Users Profiles
$userProfile = $github->getUserProfile();

echo 'Hi '.$userProfile->displayName;
```
