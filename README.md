    IMPORTANT: This is a work in progress and subject to changes at any time.

Hybridauth enables developers to easily build social applications and tools to engage websites visitors and customers on a social level by implementing social sign-in, social sharing, users profiles, friends list, activities stream, status updates and more.

The main goal of Hybridauth is to act as an abstract API between your application and various social apis and identities providers such as Facebook, Twitter and Google.

You can find complete Hybridauth documentation at https://hybridauth.github.io

#### Usage

Hybridauth provides a number of basic [examples](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/tree/master/examples).

... 

##### New way of doing things :

```php
    require 'vendor/autoload.php';

    $config = [
        'callback' => 'http://localhost/hybridauth/examples/twitter.php',

        'keys' => [ 'key'    => 'your-consumer-key', 'secret' => 'your-consumer-secret' ]
    ];

    $twitter = new Hybridauth\Provider\Twitter( $config );

    try {
        $twitter->authenticate();

        $userProfile = $twitter->getUserProfile();

        $accessToken = $twitter->getAccessToken();

        $apiResponse = $twitter->apiRequest( 'statuses/home_timeline.json' );
    }
    catch( Exception $e ){
        echo "Ooophs, we ran into an issue! " . $e->getMessage();
    }
```

##### Legacy way (Similar to Hybridauth 2.x)

Please refer to [Upgrade guide](https://hybridauth.github.io/developer-ref-migrating.html) to make the neccessary changes to your existing application in order to make it work with HybridAuth 3.x.

```php
    require 'hybridauth_autoload.php';

    $config = array(
        'base_url'  => 'http://localhost/hybridauth/examples/callback.php',

        'providers' => array(
            'GitHub' => array(
                'enabled' => true,
                'keys'    => array ( 'id' => '', 'secret' => '' ),
            )
        )
    );

    $hybridauth = new Hybridauth( $config );

    try{
        $github = $hybridauth->authenticate( "GitHub" );

        $user_profile = $github->getUserProfile();

        echo "Hi there " . $user_profile->displayName;
    }
    catch( Exception $e ){
        echo "Ooophs, we ran into an issue! " . $e->getMessage();
    }
```

#### Requirements

* PHP 5.4

#### Dependencies

Hybridauth depends on few external libraries that come already included in HybridAuth:

* [LightOpenID](https://gitorious.org/lightopenid)
* [OAuth Library](https://code.google.com/p/oauth/)

#### Installation

We recommend that you always use the latest release available at https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/releases, but we also support installation using Composer.

}
```

Install Composer and Dependencies:

```
